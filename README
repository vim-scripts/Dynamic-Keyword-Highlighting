When inspecting text, often highlighting the current search keyword isn't enough. 
This script allows you to highlight keywords and search patterns in different colors.
There are a few ways to use this functionality.

1) visual mode keyword selection
Use visual mode to select text and press <CTRL>h
The next available color will be used to highlight the keyword.
<CTRL>h without a visual mode highlight releases the last highlight.

2) search pattern selection
Perform a regular "/" search, and the press <CTRL>j
The next available color will be used to highlight matches.
<CTRL>h without a visual mode highlight releases the last highlight.

3) search pattern backtracking
The last highlighted word is set as the current search pattern.
This allows you to backtrack searches easily. For example,
- search "keyword" 
/keyword
- remember search 
<CTRL>j
- search "pattern"
/pattern
- remember search
<CTRL>j
- At this point, repeating search with just "/" will search "pattern".
   Use <CTRL>h without any visual highlight to backtrack.
  Repeating search with just "/" will now search "keyword".
